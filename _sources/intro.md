# Welcome to my portfolio

These are the projects 📔 I’ve done on my path to becoming a Data Analyst👨‍💻 where you can see how I’ve applied what I’ve learned in data manipulation and analysis over time. There are so many fields I haven’t explored yet, so I’m eager to get to know most of them. I’m darn sure I won’t regret I said, yes! to Data😎.
